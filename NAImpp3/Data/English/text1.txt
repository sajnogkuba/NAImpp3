This is a complete listing of the suburbs and localities in the greater Sydney area in alphabetical order. Sydney has about 30 local government areas, each consisting of several suburbs. Suburbs in Australia are purely geographical, not political, divisions. See table below, Category: Suburbs of Sydney and Category: Local government areas in Sydney.
Suburbs are listed here if they are inside the Sydney metro area, and are listed in the New South Wales Geographical Names Register[1] as being suburbs. For this list, the boundaries of the Sydney metro area are defined as the Hawkesbury/Nepean River in the north/north west, and then the outer boundaries of the City of Penrith, Camden Council, the City of Campbelltown and Sutherland Shire.
